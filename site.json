An up-to-date net worth statement helps clarify the specific components of the financial plan to any interested parties.\n\nA Net Worth statement will:\n\nProvide a basic sense of financial health\n\nHelp identify the overall savings available for sustainable distribution upon retirement\n\nCash Flow Statement: A document that shows annual (or monthly) inflows and outflows. A detailed cash flow statement allows for a deeper analysis beyond expenses alone. It identifies where money is coming and going and helps pinpoint possible improvements when finding new resources to improve planning outcomes.\n\nA cash flow statement summarizes income and expenses over a period. It combines budgeting with assumptions. Benefits include identifying areas for improvement or verifying the validity of planning assumptions.\n\nKey components include:\n\nCash inflows (income): Salary, investment income, rental income, business income, required minimum distributions (RMDs), and other income.\n\nCash outflows (expenses): Fixed expenses (housing, transportation, debt payments, utilities, insurance). Variable expenses (food, entertainment, personal care, medical care, and taxes).\n\nNet cash flow: Calculated by subtracting total cash outflows from total cash inflows\n\nA Cashflow Statement will:\n\nMeasure the amount of annual positive (or negative) cash flow\n\nHelp develop a realistic “vector” and identify the overall long-term sustainability of the financial plan\n\nHelp to chart financial potential\n\nHelp to identify potential tax efficiency, coordination tactics, and other financial planning opportunities.\n\nHaving professional help when analyzing financial planning documents is a good idea."

              "body": "A Net Worth statement, or Balance Sheet, is designed to be simple. It provides a comprehensive overview of your financial situation on a single page, clearly showing your net worth (assets - liabilities).\n\nStart by evaluating your financial life by jotting down your possessions: your home, car, retirement account, and even artwork. Assign a value to each item you think it could realistically fetch if sold. Next, think about your financial obligations: a mortgage, credit card debt, or loans against a 401(k). These are your liabilities.\n\nWhen filling out the balance sheet, start by entering the approximate gross values of your assets in the assets column. These are the values before any liabilities are deducted. Next, record any liabilities, which are the debts associated with your assets or separate financial obligations.\n\nTake greater control of your financial situation and track your net worth over time. Generally, the goal is to increase net worth as market investment performs, property values appreciate, and liabilities get paid off. However, it's also common (especially in retirement) for specific assets like investment accounts and cash reserves to decrease as money is spent.\n\nOver time, remember that the balance sheet is a flexible tool. It's important to keep it relevant, as it quickly and easily conveys your financial position to interested parties such as family or trusted professionals. A balance sheet also acts as a helpful resource when money needs to be raised for an unexpected event."

It is the ‘firepower” available after everything to increase or better coordinate additional money needed for tomorrow's retirement goals.\n\nTips to improve cash flow may include:\n\nEliminating or reducing non-essential expenses\n\nIncreasing income or working longer\n\nSelling or rethinking an existing asset’s strategy\n\nBeing more tax-efficient\n\nTaking (or delaying) social security or a pension\n\nRefinancing or tapping into a home’s equity\n\nOnce positive cash flow is identified, one can start determining and consistently setting aside savings. Assess how much can be saved, then decide where to save it. This savings location decision should be based on the appropriateness of the savings vehicle, eligibility to contribute, the correct type of contribution (e.g., pre or post-tax money), and tax savings today versus tomorrow.\n\nTypically, advisors suggest saving around 15% of gross income. However, this is a broad recommendation. Various factors collectively determine what’s needed to meet retirement needs."

              "body": "Use this exercise to coordinate savings locations. Determine the current level of savings versus total gross income (or income before any deductions or taxes). Generally, retirement savings are money set aside for longer periods. These dollars are targeted for retirement income or to supplement future retirement expenses and likely have a much different strategy than more near-term dollars.\n\nStart by researching your various savings accounts. These could be employer retirement plans, such as a 401(k), or supplemental accounts, like a Roth or post-tax account. Typically, bank checking accounts are money set aside for emergencies or planned expenses, so contributions may not be part of retirement-oriented savings.\n\nNext, finalize the spreadsheet by adding the account name, type of account, taxable nature (e.g., Traditional or Roth), and contribution amount (bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, or annual). If a participant has access to multiple plans, ensure the accuracy of contributions and that there is no overfunding. The spreadsheet should automatically validate total savings and then convert this total to a percentage relative to gross income. The beauty of this exercise is its flexibility. Our general guideline is to save approximately 15% of gross income; however, this can vary significantly depending on savings requirements and life stage.\n\nConsider other areas for savings, such as reducing discretionary spending, cutting down on unnecessary subscriptions, or finding ways to save on utilities. If needed, use our budget worksheet, a tool designed to help you track your income and expenses, to help identify these areas of improvement. You can then redirect these dollars toward savings.\n\nCommit to revisiting this worksheet periodically to ensure the current level of retirement savings is on pace. Remember to update gross income and individual savings amounts to reflect your overall savings accurately."

Remember, it's not just about the numbers; understanding what truly matters to you is equally, if not more, important. So, while the financial aspects are crucial, maintaining a rich and fulfilling experience in retirement is equally important.\n\nTake a moment to reflect deeply on retirement objectives. Engage with the various aspects of the exercise, one by one, and start contemplating what holds the most significance and potential priorities over others. Some may be necessities, while others may be lifestyle choices. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers; embrace your unique perspective.\n\nExercise your freedom to assign a value to each of the categories. This process involves controlling your retirement planning and prioritizing according to your values. Consider adding notes for future reference to monitor how your priorities evolve, providing you with a sense of empowerment throughout the retirement journey.\n\nRemember, the lifestyle planner is not a one-time task. It's a dynamic tool that should reflect your evolving priorities. Feel free to add or adjust the values of the exercise. Your circumstances are unique, and general categories may benefit from specificity. The aim is to identify your current priorities and reevaluate them as retirement approaches or even after retirement. This process will assist you in gaining deeper insights into your qualitative priorities today and over time.\n\nIt's important to understand that priorities can shift once retired, and the actual landscape of formal retirement becomes clear. Retirement planning is a complex process, and your priorities may change as you navigate different stages of retirement. Embrace this fluidity and be prepared to adapt your plans accordingly.\n\nThe future of advice is an objective and personalized experience.
