An up-to-date net worth statement helps clarify the specific components of the financial plan to any interested parties.</p>\n<p>A Net Worth statement will:</p>\n<p>Provide a basic sense of financial health</p>\n<p>Help identify the overall savings available for sustainable distribution upon retirement</p>\n<p>Cash Flow Statement: A document that shows annual (or monthly) inflows and outflows. A detailed cash flow statement allows for a deeper analysis beyond expenses alone. It identifies where money is coming and going and helps pinpoint possible improvements when finding new resources to improve planning outcomes.</p>\n<p>A cash flow statement summarizes income and expenses over a period. It combines budgeting with assumptions. Benefits include identifying areas for improvement or verifying the validity of planning assumptions.</p>\n<p>Key components include:</p>\n<p>Cash inflows (income): Salary, investment income, rental income, business income, required minimum distributions (RMDs), and other income.</p>\n<p>Cash outflows (expenses): Fixed expenses (housing, transportation, debt payments, utilities, insurance). Variable expenses (food, entertainment, personal care, medical care, and taxes).</p>\n<p>Net cash flow: Calculated by subtracting total cash outflows from total cash inflows</p>\n<p>A Cashflow Statement will:</p>\n<p>Measure the amount of annual positive (or negative) cash flow</p>\n<p>Help develop a realistic “vector” and identify the overall long-term sustainability of the financial plan</p>\n<p>Help to chart financial potential</p>\n<p>Help to identify potential tax efficiency, coordination tactics, and other financial planning opportunities.</p>\n<p>Having professional help when analyzing financial planning documents is a good idea.</p>\n<h3>How can I estimate my net worth?</h3>\n<p>A Net Worth statement, or Balance Sheet, is designed to be simple. It provides a comprehensive overview of your financial situation on a single page, clearly showing your net worth (assets - liabilities).</p>\n<p>Start by evaluating your financial life by jotting down your possessions: your home, car, retirement account, and even artwork. Assign a value to each item you think it could realistically fetch if sold. Next, think about your financial obligations: a mortgage, credit card debt, or loans against a 401(k). These are your liabilities.</p>\n<p>When filling out the balance sheet, start by entering the approximate gross values of your assets in the assets column. These are the values before any liabilities are deducted. Next, record any liabilities, which are the debts associated with your assets or separate financial obligations.</p>\n<p>Take greater control of your financial situation and track your net worth over time. Generally, the goal is to increase net worth as market investment performs, property values appreciate, and liabilities get paid off. However, it&#x27;s also common (especially in retirement) for specific assets like investment accounts and cash reserves to decrease as money is spent.</p>\n<p>Over time, remember that the balance sheet is a flexible tool. It&#x27;s important to keep it relevant, as it quickly and easily conveys your financial position to interested parties such as family or trusted professionals. A balance sheet also acts as a helpful resource when money needs to be raised for an unexpected event.</p>",

          "html": "<p>POSITIVE CASH FLOW is new money identified as being available to save or deploy in addition to what is already being spent or contributed towards savings. It is the ‘firepower” available after everything to increase or better coordinate additional money needed for tomorrow&#x27;s retirement goals.</p>\n<p>Tips to improve cash flow may include:</p>\n<p>Eliminating or reducing non-essential expenses</p>\n<p>Increasing income or working longer</p>\n<p>Selling or rethinking an existing asset’s strategy</p>\n<p>Being more tax-efficient</p>\n<p>Taking (or delaying) social security or a pension</p>\n<p>Refinancing or tapping into a home’s equity</p>\n<p>Once positive cash flow is identified, one can start determining and consistently setting aside savings. Assess how much can be saved, then decide where to save it. This savings location decision should be based on the appropriateness of the savings vehicle, eligibility to contribute, the correct type of contribution (e.g., pre or post-tax money), and tax savings today versus tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Typically, advisors suggest saving around 15% of gross income. However, this is a broad recommendation. Various factors collectively determine what’s needed to meet retirement needs.</p>\n<h3>How can I calculate my savings?</h3>\n<p>Use this exercise to coordinate savings locations. Determine the current level of savings versus total gross income (or income before any deductions or taxes). Generally, retirement savings are money set aside for longer periods. These dollars are targeted for retirement income or to supplement future retirement expenses and likely have a much different strategy than more near-term dollars.</p>\n<p>Start by researching your various savings accounts. These could be employer retirement plans, such as a 401(k), or supplemental accounts, like a Roth or post-tax account. Typically, bank checking accounts are money set aside for emergencies or planned expenses, so contributions may not be part of retirement-oriented savings. </p>\n<p>Next, finalize the spreadsheet by adding the account name, type of account, taxable nature (e.g., Traditional or Roth), and contribution amount (bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, or annual). If a participant has access to multiple plans, ensure the accuracy of contributions and that there is no overfunding. The spreadsheet should automatically validate total savings and then convert this total to a percentage relative to gross income. The beauty of this exercise is its flexibility. Our general guideline is to save approximately 15% of gross income; however, this can vary significantly depending on savings requirements and life stage.</p>\n<p>Consider other areas for savings, such as reducing discretionary spending, cutting down on unnecessary subscriptions, or finding ways to save on utilities. If needed, use our budget worksheet, a tool designed to help you track your income and expenses, to help identify these areas of improvement. You can then redirect these dollars toward savings.</p>\n<p>Commit to revisiting this worksheet periodically to ensure the current level of retirement savings is on pace. Remember to update gross income and individual savings amounts to reflect your overall savings accurately. </p>",

A plan constructed in this fashion is more organized, never rushed, and should be motivated by self-interest.</p>\n<p>No one should ever care more about your money than you.</p>\n<p>Once complete, the totality of the financial planning landscape should become apparent. At this moment, a genuinely rational decision can be made and executed with full confidence.</p>\n<p>The benefits of having a rational planning process include the following:</p>\n<p>Plan recall, or the ability to pick up where one left off</p>\n<p>Higher decision confidence</p>\n<p>Opportune pace building</p>\n<p>More cooperative and substantial discussions</p>\n<p>Getting to the &quot;truth&quot;</p>\n<p>Identification of complex or time-consuming tasks</p>\n<p>Better coordination and greater efficiency </p>\n<p>More authority over the implementation process</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Financial planning is becoming much more about you, the client. For the first time in history, the landscape for objective financial guidance is finally taking shape.</h3>\n<h3>Why seek the objective truth?</h3>\n<p>We define objectivity as the concept of truth independent of individual subjectivity. It is the process of reaching independent conclusions distinct from any end product or service. It is a personal interpretation guided by a process in pursuit of truth through knowledge. Objectivity is about embracing a rational process, seeing what follows, and drawing independent conclusions.\n\nObjectivity is “thinking for yourself,” without it, uncertainty thrives.</p>\n<h3>How can I prioritize my lifestyle?</h3>\n<p>The lifestyle planner exercise is a crucial tool providing essential qualitative insights about yourself and your loved ones. This exercise will introduce the most common personal objectives in retirement planning, all tailored to your unique circumstances. Remember, it&#x27;s not just about the numbers; understanding what truly matters to you is equally, if not more, important. So, while the financial aspects are crucial, maintaining a rich and fulfilling experience in retirement is equally important.</p>\n<p>Take a moment to reflect deeply on retirement objectives. Engage with the various aspects of the exercise, one by one, and start contemplating what holds the most significance and potential priorities over others. Some may be necessities, while others may be lifestyle choices. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers; embrace your unique perspective.</p>\n<p>Exercise your freedom to assign a value to each of the categories. This process involves controlling your retirement planning and prioritizing according to your values. Consider adding notes for future reference to monitor how your priorities evolve, providing you with a sense of empowerment throughout the retirement journey.</p>\n<p>Remember, the lifestyle planner is not a one-time task. It&#x27;s a dynamic tool that should reflect your evolving priorities. Feel free to add or adjust the values of the exercise. Your circumstances are unique, and general categories may benefit from specificity. The aim is to identify your current priorities and reevaluate them as retirement approaches or even after retirement. This process will assist you in gaining deeper insights into your qualitative priorities today and over time.</p>\n<p>It&#x27;s important to understand that priorities can shift once retired, and the actual landscape of formal retirement becomes clear. Retirement planning is a complex process, and your priorities may change as you navigate different stages of retirement. Embrace this fluidity and be prepared to adapt your plans accordingly.</p>\n<p>The future of advice is an objective and personalized experience. But ultimately, that&#x27;s up to you.</p>\n<p>Benefits of objective financial planning include:</p>\n<p>Greater confidence with personal decisions</p>\n<p>Simplicity and reduced anxiety</p>\n<p>Better organization and higher participation</p>\n<p>Greater financial stamina</p>\n<p>Reduced “sales pitch” fatigue</p>\n<p>Higher trust in end decisions and professional insight</p>\n<p>More control and understanding over consequential decisions </p>",

Financial decisions regarding tax, investments, income, health, and personal affinities are often highly subjective.</p>\n<h3>Life is not math.</h3>\n<p>Financial and personal preferences often clash. These conflicts potentially result in disjointed and rushed decisions, requiring more context and frequently manifesting into uninformed guesswork.</p>\n<p>The culprit is frequently the unknowable subjectivity of the financial plan. If planning were simply a mathematical equation to “solve,” the process would be finite and much less subjective. </p>\n<h3>Having a Battle Plan</h3>\n<p>The perfect financial planning strategy will not materialize through happenstance.

A cohesive strategy forms and a plan of attack ensues.</p>\n<p>In planning strategy serves as a roadmap to guide financial decisions and actions, aligning them with long-term goals and aspirations. </p>\n<p>This strategy should encompass various elements, including savings and investments, debt management, insurance coverage, tax planning, and retirement planning.

          "html": "<p>MONEY’S PURCHASING power erodes over time. Solely depending on what has been the historical inflation rate is no guarantee of future inflation.</p>\n<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) can provide a basic understanding of the changes in consumer prices over time and the general direction of an individual&#x27;s expenses.</p>\n<h3>What’s the CPI?</h3>\n<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a widely used measure of inflation. It provides a comprehensive overview of the change in prices of a representative basket of goods and services purchased by consumers. In other words, it&#x27;s a tool that economists and financial planners use to act as a rough benchmark of how the cost of living is changing over time.</p>\n<p>However, scholars argue that the CPI doesn’t perfectly report regional price variations for specific groups. For instance, Americans living in expensive cities may have much different spending behaviors than Americans living in suburban or rural areas.</p>\n<p>Another consideration of the CPI is that it may only sometimes reflect certain expenses.</p>\n<p>Data limitations of the CPI should prompt retirees to consider how inflation might differ among certain expenses.</p>\n<p>Examples include:</p>\n<p>Education</p>\n<p>Medical costs</p>\n<p>Housing</p>\n<h3>Inflation Rates</h3>\n<p>Most financial professionals agree that using a 3% inflation rate is a good place to start.</p>\n<p>Historically, inflation has averaged about 3% over 30 years.</p>\n<p>When adjusting for inflation, the individual may customize an inflation rate for specific items. Common expenses one might separately consider to the standard 3% inflation rate may include:</p>\n<p>Certain medical costs</p>\n<p>Education expenses</p>\n<p>Food preferences</p>\n<p>Transportation requirements</p>\n<p>“The improved confidence could be linked to increased confidence in income, with 28% of workers and 32% of retirees attributing their confidence to stable finances.1 This is supported by the U.S. Census data indicating that wage growth is exceeding inflation growth.”</p>\n<p>The economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a mixed picture. On one hand, unemployment is currently lower, the stock market is higher, and job creation is faster than pre-pandemic levels. These are positive indicators not seen in recent decades. On the other hand, the cost of living has increased significantly due to inflation, which has affected many countries worldwide. While the US has experienced a tough bout of inflation, it has fared better than other G7 nations in this regard. Currently, wages are outpacing prices, suggesting that workers are gaining ground even with inflation. However, it is important to recognize that these are aggregate figures, and the impact of inflation can vary considerably among individuals and households. It&#x27;s reassuring to note that the government is actively working to address the issue of rising costs and mitigate the negative effects of inflation.</p>\n<h3>It’s Our Economy</h3>\n<p>Historically, the Federal Reserve and policymakers have used various methods to address rising inflation. </p>\n<p>These methods include:</p>\n<p>Monetary Policy: Central banks like the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates to curb borrowing and spending, thus reducing demand and slowing down price increases</p>\n<p>Fiscal Policy: Governments can use taxation and spending to influence the economy and manage inflation</p>\n<p>Supply-Side Policies: Addressing supply chain disruptions, increasing productivity, and promoting competition can help mitigate inflation by increasing the availability of goods and services</p>\n<h3>Economic powers beyond inflation</h3>\n<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary agency responsible for tracking inflation and wage-related statistics in the United States. The BLS publishes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI), which are widely used measures of inflation.</p>\n<p>The CPI measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services purchased by consumers. The PPI measures the change in prices of goods sold by producers. Both the CPI and PPI are published monthly and can be found on the BLS website.</p>\n<p>Wage growth can positively impact individuals and households by increasing their purchasing power and improving their standard of living.</p>\n<p>While wage growth exceeding inflation and falling unemployment rates can be indicators of mitigating inflation under certain conditions, they are not guaranteed solutions. </p>\n<p>Indications that support mitigating inflation.</p>\n<p>Increased purchasing power: If wages grow faster than prices, people have more disposable income. This can stimulate demand, leading to increased production and economic growth, which can help counteract inflationary pressures.</p>\n<p>Reduced unemployment: Falling unemployment rates usually mean more people are earning wages. This can increase overall economic activity and potentially dampen inflation through increased supply.</p>\n<p>Increased productivity: Wage growth is sometimes tied to increased productivity. If workers produce more goods and services, this can help keep prices stable or even lower.</p>\n<p>Indications that do not support mitigating inflation.</p>\n<p>The Wage-price spiral: Businesses sometimes raise prices to cover increased labor costs. These increases by businesses can lead to a cycle in which wages and prices trend upwards, potentially fueling inflation rather than mitigating it.</p>\n<p>Demand-pull inflation: Increased purchasing power due to higher wages could lead to excessive demand for goods and services, exceeding supply and driving prices up.</p>\n<p>Other factors: Supply chain disruptions and global events can also affect inflation, potentially counteracting any mitigating effects of wage growth and low unemployment.</p>\n<p>The relationship between these factors and inflation is complex and influenced by various economic forces.</p>",
