A plan constructed in this fashion is more organized, never rushed, and should be motivated by self-interest.\n\nNo one should ever care more about your money than you.\n\nOnce complete, the totality of the financial planning landscape should become apparent. At this moment, a genuinely rational decision can be made and executed with full confidence.\n\nThe benefits of having a rational planning process include the following:\n\n• Plan recall, or the ability to pick up where one left off\n• Higher decision confidence\n• Opportune pace building\n• More cooperative and substantial discussions\n• Getting to the \"truth\"\n• Identification of complex or time-consuming tasks\n• Better coordination and greater efficiency\n• More authority over the implementation process\n\nThe Future of Financial Advice Is Today\n\nFinancial planning is becoming much more about you, the client. For the first time in history, the landscape for objective financial guidance is finally taking shape."

              "body": "We define objectivity as the concept of truth independent of individual subjectivity. It is the process of reaching independent conclusions distinct from any end product or service. It is a personal interpretation guided by a process in pursuit of truth through knowledge. Objectivity is about embracing a rational process, seeing what follows, and drawing independent conclusions.Objectivity is “thinking for yourself,” without it, uncertainty thrives."

              "body": "The lifestyle planner exercise is a crucial tool providing essential qualitative insights about yourself and your loved ones. This exercise will introduce the most common personal objectives in retirement planning, all tailored to your unique circumstances. Remember, it's not just about the numbers; understanding what truly matters to you is equally, if not more, important. So, while the financial aspects are crucial, maintaining a rich and fulfilling experience in retirement is equally important.\n\nTake a moment to reflect deeply on retirement objectives. Engage with the various aspects of the exercise, one by one, and start contemplating what holds the most significance and potential priorities over others. Some may be necessities, while others may be lifestyle choices. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers; embrace your unique perspective.\n\nExercise your freedom to assign a value to each of the categories. This process involves controlling your retirement planning and prioritizing according to your values. Consider adding notes for future reference to monitor how your priorities evolve, providing you with a sense of empowerment throughout the retirement journey.\n\nRemember, the lifestyle planner is not a one-time task. It's a dynamic tool that should reflect your evolving priorities. Feel free to add or adjust the values of the exercise. Your circumstances are unique, and general categories may benefit from specificity. The aim is to identify your current priorities and reevaluate them as retirement approaches or even after retirement. This process will assist you in gaining deeper insights into your qualitative priorities today and over time.\n\nIt's
