This exercise will introduce the most common personal objectives in retirement planning, all tailored to your unique circumstances. Remember, it's not just about the numbers; understanding what truly matters to you is equally, if not more, important. So, while the financial aspects are crucial, maintaining a rich and fulfilling experience in retirement is equally important.\n\nTake a moment to reflect deeply on retirement objectives. Engage with the various aspects of the exercise, one by one, and start contemplating what holds the most significance and potential priorities over others. Some may be necessities, while others may be lifestyle choices. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers; embrace your unique perspective.\n\nExercise your freedom to assign a value to each of the categories. This process involves controlling your retirement planning and prioritizing according to your values. Consider adding notes for future reference to monitor how your priorities evolve, providing you with a sense of empowerment throughout the retirement journey.\n\nRemember, the lifestyle planner is not a one-time task. It's a dynamic tool that should reflect your evolving priorities. Feel free to add or adjust the values of the exercise. Your circumstances are unique, and general categories may benefit from specificity. The aim is to identify your current priorities and reevaluate them as retirement approaches or even after retirement. This process will assist you in gaining deeper insights into your qualitative priorities today and over time.\n\nIt's important to understand that priorities can shift once retired, and the actual landscape of formal retirement becomes clear. Retirement planning is a complex process, and your priorities may change as you navigate different stages of retirement. Embrace this fluidity and be prepared to adapt your plans accordingly.\n\nThe future of advice is an objective and personalized experience. But ultimately, that's up to you.\n\nBenefits of objective financial planning include:\n\n• Greater confidence with personal decisions\n• Simplicity and reduced anxiety\n• Better organization and higher participation\n• Greater financial stamina\n• Reduced “sales pitch” fatigue\n• Higher trust in end decisions and professional insight\n• More control and understanding over consequential decisions"

But don't worry, it's much more manageable than it seems. You can easily download all your year-end expenses from the bank in a .csv or spreadsheet format. Open the file and copy and paste all the values into the course material spreadsheet.\n\nOnce done, ensure the values are positive numbers. If not, you can quickly convert negative values to positive ones using the ABS function.\n\nTo simplify, Copy (ctrl+c) and Paste special → Values only (Ctrl+Shift+V). Now, all the hard work is done.\n\nOnce you've got all the numbers in the spreadsheet, classify them. The sheet should automatically populate the embedded chart with your data. But don't stop there. Add more colors, customize, and get creative to get the results you're looking for. Your budget reflects your financial goals and aspirations, so take pride in finessing them.\n\nFor most people, reworking a budget more than once a year is probably unnecessary. However, how frequently remains a personal choice. We recommend revisiting it every so often to maintain a sense of expense. It can be helpful when working with a financial professional who may need to know how much expense pressure to assume when modeling withdrawal scenarios.

On one hand, unemployment is currently lower, the stock market is higher, and job creation is faster than pre-pandemic levels. These are positive indicators not seen in recent decades. On the other hand, the cost of living has increased significantly due to inflation, which has affected many countries worldwide. While the US has experienced a tough bout of inflation, it has fared better than other G7 nations in this regard. Currently, wages are outpacing prices, suggesting that workers are gaining ground even with inflation. However, it is important to recognize that these are aggregate figures, and the impact of inflation can vary considerably among individuals and households.

This can stimulate demand, leading to increased production and economic growth, which can help counteract inflationary pressures.\n• Reduced unemployment: Falling unemployment rates usually mean more people are earning wages. This can increase overall economic activity and potentially dampen inflation through increased supply.\n• Increased productivity: Wage growth is sometimes tied to increased productivity. If workers produce more goods and services, this can help keep prices stable or even lower.\n\nIndications that do not support mitigating inflation.\n\n• The Wage-price spiral: Businesses sometimes raise prices to cover increased labor costs. These increases by businesses can lead to a cycle in which wages and prices trend upwards, potentially fueling inflation rather than mitigating it.\n• Demand-pull inflation: Increased purchasing power due to higher wages could lead to excessive demand for goods and services, exceeding supply and driving prices up.\n• Other factors: Supply chain disruptions and global events can also affect inflation, potentially counteracting any mitigating effects of wage growth and low unemployment.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and inflation is complex and influenced by various economic forces."

Assign a value to each item you think it could realistically fetch if sold. Next, think about your financial obligations: a mortgage, credit card debt, or loans against a 401(k). These are your liabilities.\n\nWhen filling out the balance sheet, start by entering the approximate gross values of your assets in the assets column. These are the values before any liabilities are deducted. Next, record any liabilities, which are the debts associated with your assets or separate financial obligations.\n\nTake greater control of your financial situation and track your net worth over time. Generally, the goal is to increase net worth as market investment performs, property values appreciate, and liabilities get paid off. However, it's also common (especially in retirement) for specific assets like investment accounts and cash reserves to decrease as money is spent.\n\nOver time, remember that the balance sheet is a flexible tool.

It is the ‘firepower” available after everything to increase or better coordinate additional money needed for tomorrow's retirement goals.\n\nTips to improve cash flow may include:\n\n• Eliminating or reducing non-essential expenses\n• Increasing income or working longer\n• Selling or rethinking an existing asset’s strategy\n• Being more tax-efficient\n• Taking (or delaying) social security or a pension\n• Refinancing or tapping into a home’s equity\n\nOnce positive cash flow is identified, one can start determining and consistently setting aside savings. Assess how much can be saved, then decide where to save it. This savings location decision should be based on the appropriateness of the savings vehicle, eligibility to contribute, the correct type of contribution (e.g., pre or post-tax money), and tax savings today versus tomorrow.\n\n[[img:10]]\n\nTypically, advisors suggest saving around 15% of gross income. However, this is a broad recommendation. Various factors collectively determine what’s needed to meet retirement needs."

              "body": "Use this exercise to coordinate savings locations. Determine the current level of savings versus total gross income (or income before any deductions or taxes). Generally, retirement savings are money set aside for longer periods. These dollars are targeted for retirement income or to supplement future retirement expenses and likely have a much different strategy than more near-term dollars.\n\nStart by researching your various savings accounts. These could be employer retirement plans, such as a 401(k), or supplemental accounts, like a Roth or post-tax account. Typically, bank checking accounts are money set aside for emergencies or planned expenses, so contributions may not be part of retirement-oriented savings.\n\nNext, finalize the spreadsheet by adding the account name, type of account, taxable nature (e.g., Traditional or Roth), and contribution amount (bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, or annual). If a participant has access to multiple plans, ensure the accuracy of contributions and that there is no overfunding. The spreadsheet should automatically validate total savings and then convert this total to a percentage relative to gross income. The beauty of this exercise is its flexibility. Our general guideline is to save approximately 15% of gross income; however, this can vary significantly depending on savings requirements and life stage.\n\nConsider other areas for savings, such as reducing discretionary spending, cutting down on unnecessary subscriptions, or finding ways to save on utilities. If needed, use our budget worksheet, a tool designed to help you track your income and expenses, to help identify these areas of improvement. You can then redirect these dollars toward savings.\n\nCommit to revisiting this worksheet periodically to ensure the current level of retirement savings is on pace. Remember to update gross income and individual savings amounts to reflect your overall savings accurately."
