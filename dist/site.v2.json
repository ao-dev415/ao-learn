An up-to-date net worth statement helps clarify the specific components of the financial plan to any interested parties.\n\nA Net Worth statement will:\n- Provide a basic sense of financial health  \n- Help identify the overall savings available for sustainable distribution upon retirement\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:** A document that shows annual (or monthly) inflows and outflows. A detailed cash flow statement allows for a deeper analysis beyond expenses alone. It identifies where money is coming and going and helps pinpoint possible improvements when finding new resources to improve planning outcomes.\n\nKey components include:\n- **Cash inflows (income):** Salary, investment income, rental income, business income, RMDs, and other income.  \n- **Cash outflows (expenses):** Fixed (housing, transportation, debt, utilities, insurance) and variable (food, entertainment, personal care, medical care, taxes).  \n- **Net cash flow:** Total inflows minus total outflows.\n\nHaving professional help when analyzing financial planning documents is a good idea.",
